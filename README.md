# CAFA (Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation) for aphylo

This project is a response to the reviewers of our paper submitted to PLOS Comp
Bio. We will use the CAFA project to benchmark the quality of the predictions
generated by aphylo.

For the paper, we will be using CAFA 3, although CAFA 4 is in progress as I
write this (more info [here](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn21035948/wiki/597155)).

## Implementation plan:

1. Use the most recent published version of CAFA

2. Apply the aphylo model to each challenge

3. Report (sounds simple)

## Observations

Things to overcome: It seems that CAFA constists on raw sequences without
trees, which would require us to estimate the trees (we don't do that). An
alternative to this could be take the tree predictions that other models
have done and use those as a baseline to run our model.

Also important to remember, not all these methods are phylo based, which is
why there is no information about the phylogenies. I would be using either
PantherDB or UniProt to get the tree information. Also, it seems that the
experiment just indicates which proteins/genes need to be annotated, yet I
don't see what are the relevant annotations.

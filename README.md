# CAFA (Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation) for aphylo

Implementation plan:

1. Use the most recent published version of CAFA

2. Apply the aphylo model to each challenge

3. Report (sounds simple)

Things to overcome: It seems that CAFA constists on raw sequences without
trees, which would require us to estimate the trees (we don't do that). An
alternative to this could be take the tree predictions that other models
have done and use those as a baseline to run our model.
